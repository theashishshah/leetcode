title = Implementing Selection Sort



difficulty = Easy

desc -----
Given a sequence of size N containing positive integers. You need to arrange the elements of sequence in increasing order using selection sort.
Input
User Task:
Since this a functional problem you don't have to take any input , you just need to complete the function selection_sort(seq) which is taking  sequence of numbers as parameter in list form.

Custom Input:
First line of the input denotes number of test cases 'T'. First line of the test case is the size of array and second line consists of array elements.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^3
1 <= A[i] <= 10^3
Output
Return the sorted list.






Example
Input:
2
5
4 1 3 9 7
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

Output:
1 3 4 7 9
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

solution -----
def selection_sort(seq):
    for i in range(len(seq)):
        l = i
        for j in range(i+1,len(seq)):
            if seq[j]<seq[l]:
                l = j
        seq[i],seq[l] = seq[l],seq[i]
    return seq
