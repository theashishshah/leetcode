1 ≤ d ≤ 109

test Cases -----



solution -----
def calculate_percentage(maths,sci,english):
    total= maths+sci+english
    percentage = (total/300)*100
    return total,percentage

maths= int(input())
sci= int(input())
english= int(input())

total, percentage = calculate_percentage(maths,sci,english)

print(total)
print(percentage)
