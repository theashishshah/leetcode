desc -----
Given the weekly rental cost of a book X, the number of days you want to rent the book D, and your status as a staff member S (where S="true" if you are a staff member, otherwise S="false"), calculate the total rental cost based on the following rules:
 

1. The cost to rent the book for up to 7 days is X.
2. If D exceeds 7 days and you are not staff member, an additional charge of 2 Rs per extra day is applied.
3. If you are staff member, no extra charges apply for exceeding 7 days.
4. The full weekly cost X is charged even if you rent the book for less than 7 days.

Write a program to determine the total cost of renting the book.

Input
The input consists of three lines:
X: An integer representing the weekly rental cost of a book.
D: An integer representing the number of days the book was rented.
S: A string(either "true" or "false") indicating whether the person is a staff member.


Output
Print a single integer representing the total amount a person has to pay for D days.



Example
Input:
50
10
false

Output
56

Explanation:
The cost to rent the book for 7 days is 50.
Remaining (3) days, person had to pay 2rs per day i. e. 3 x 2 = 6rs
Since the person was not a member of staff, he will have to pay the extra fine.
So, total fine = 50 + 6 = 56




Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 109
1 ≤ d ≤ 109

X = int(input())
D = int(input())
S = str(input())
if D<= 7:
    print(X)
elif D>7 and S == "false":
    total = X+(D-7)*2
    print(total)
else :
    print(X)
