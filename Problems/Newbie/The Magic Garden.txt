title = The Magic Garden


difficulty = easy

desc -----
In a magical garden, the number of flowers doubles each day. If you start with n flowers, write a Python program to find out how many flowers you'll have after d days.

Example: 
Suppose you begin with 3 flowers in the magical garden. Since the flowers double each day, by the end of the first day, you'll have 6 flowers. By the second day, the count increases to 12 flowers, and by the third day, it reaches 24 flowers.

Note: Your program should compute the total number of flowers for any given number of days d.

Input
First line will contain an integer n representing number of flowers.
Second line will contain an integer d representing number of days.

Output
Print the total number of flowers after the d days.



Example
Input
2
4

Output
32

Explanation
There will be 32 flowers after 4 days



Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 109
1 ≤ d ≤ 109

solution -----
def flowers_after_days(n, d):
    total_flowers = n * (2 ** d)
    return total_flowers

n = int(input())
d = int(input())

print(flowers_after_days(n, d))
