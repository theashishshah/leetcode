title = Matrix Multiplication


difficulty = Medium

desc -----
You are given two square matrices A and B of size N x N. Your task is to multiply the two matrices and return the resulting matrix C.


Input
An integer N representing the size of the square matrices
Two matrices A and B of size N x N. Each matrix contains N rows and N columns.


Constraints
All matrix elements are integers, which can be both positive and negative.
The matrices are square, i.e., both A and B have dimensions N x N.
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
Output
The resulting matrix C after multiplying matrices A and B.






Example

for _ in range(n):
    t = list(map(int,input().split()))
    a.append(t)
for _ in range(n):
    t = list(map(int,input().split()))
    b.append(t)

p = []
for _ in range(n):
    p.append([0]*n)

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        sum = 0
        for k in range(n):
            p[i][j] += a[i][k]*b[k][j]
for i in p:
    for j in i:
        print(j,end=" ")
    print()
