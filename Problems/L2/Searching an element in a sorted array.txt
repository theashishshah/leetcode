title = Searching an element in a sorted array


difficulty = Medium

desc -----
Given a sorted array arr of N integers and a number X is given. The task is to check if the element X is present in the array or not.

Note: Try to use binary search to solve the problem
Input
User Task
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to input anything, your task is to complete the function isPresent(), which takes three parameters as input, those are: the size of an array, the input array and the integer to find (X).

Custon Input:
The first line of input contains a number of test cases T. For each test case, the first line of input contains a number of elements in the array, and the number X is separated by space. The next line contains N elements.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ X ≤ 109
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109

Sum of N over all test cases doesn't exceed 106
Output
If the element is present in the array return "1" else return "-1".






Example
Sample Input:
2
5 6
1 2 3 4 6
5 2
1 3 4 5 6

Sample Output:
1
-1

def isPresent(n,arr,x):
    start = 0
    end = len(arr)-1

    while start <= end:
        mid = (start+end)//2
        if x > arr[mid]:
            start = mid + 1
        elif x < arr[mid]:
            end =  mid - 1
        elif x == arr[mid]:
            return 1
    return -1
