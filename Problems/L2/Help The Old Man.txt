desc -----
An elderly woman working at a hotel needed money urgently for her husband's surgery. The hotel owner offered to cover the costs and double her salary if she passed a test.
The test involved moving a stack of plates from Box A to Box C using Box B, following these rules:

-> Only one plate can be moved at a time.
-> A larger plate cannot be placed on top of a smaller one.
-> Plates can only be taken from the top.

Given N plates, number them from top to bottom as 1 to N. Write the sequence of steps to transfer all plates from Box A to Box C in the minimum number of moves.

Input
First line contains a single integer N representing number of plates.

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 16
Output
Print sequence of moving plates, where each move is shown in the following format-
{PlateNumber}:{FromBox}->{ToBox}
Each move in the sequence is separated by a new line





Example
Input
2
Output
1:A->B
2:A->C
1:B->C
