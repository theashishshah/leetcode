title = Target Difference


difficulty = easy

desc -----
Given a one-dimensional sorted array A containing N integers. You are also given an integer target, find if there exists a pair of elements in the array whose difference is equal to the target. Approach this problem in O(n).
Input
The first line contains a single integer N.
The second line contains N space- separated integers A[i].
The third line contains an integer target.

Constraints
1<=N<=10^5
0<=A[i]<=10^9
0<=target<=10^9
Output
Print Yes if pair with given difference exists in our array otherwise print No.




Example
Sample Input 1:
5
1 2 7 9 11
5
Sample Output 1:
Yes

Sample Input 2:
5
1 1 8 8 25
0
Sample Output 2:
Yes

solution -----
n = int(input())
l = list(map(int,input().split()))
t = int(input())

s = 0
e = 1

while(e<n):
    if l[e]-l[s]==t:
        print("Yes")
        break
    elif l[e]-l[s]>t:
        s += 1
    elif l[e]-l[s]<t:
        e += 1
else:
    print("No")
