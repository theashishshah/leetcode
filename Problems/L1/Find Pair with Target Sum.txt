title = Find Pair with Target Sum


difficulty = Medium

desc -----
You are given a sorted array of integers arr[] and an integer target. Your task is to determine if there exists a pair of numbers in the array whose sum equals the target. You need to return True if such a pair exists, otherwise return False

Note:
This is a functional problem, you need to complete the function has_pair_with_sum(arr,target) and return True or False from the above function, you do not need to read input or print the output i.e. no need to use print()/input() functions.
You need to return boolean True or False
Input
The first line of input contains sorted array of integers arr, (space-seperated integers), where 1 ≤ len(arr) ≤ 10^5 and -10^6 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6.
The second line of input contains a single integer representing the target sum, where -10^6 ≤ target ≤ 10^6.

Constraints
1 ≤ len(arr) ≤ 105
-10^6 ≤ target ≤ 10^6.
Output
Return True if there exists a pair of numbers a and b in the array such that a + b = target.
Return False otherwise.





Example
Input
1 2 3 4 5
8

Output
True

Explanation
It can be seen that the elements at indices 2 and 4 sum up to 8 i.e. arr[2] + arr[4] = 3 + 5 = 8, hence we return True

Input
-1 0 1 2 3 4
3

Output
True

Explanation
It can be seen that the elements at indices 2 and 3 sum up to 3 i.e. arr[2] + arr[3] = 2 + 3 = 5, hence we return True
There are multiple pairs with sum 3 like (-1,4),(0,3), we just need to trace at least one, hence answer is True

solution -----

def has_pair_with_sum(arr, target):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1

    while i<j:
        if arr[i] + arr[j] > target:
            j -= 1
        elif arr[i] + arr[j] < target:
            i += 1
        else:
            return True

    return False
